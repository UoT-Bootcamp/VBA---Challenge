# Multiple years stock - Automation using VBA

In this project, we created a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

* The ticker symbol.
* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock.
* We formatted the sheet using conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

CHALLENGES:

Below were the challenges part:

* Calculate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". The solution will look as follows:
* Make the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
